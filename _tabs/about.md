H0ax-Hacks was created for the purpose of providing detailed CTF writeups for sites such as Hack The Box and TryHackMe. These writeups are aimed toward those who are just getting into CTF challenges/Penetration Testing so that they can learn and understand what exactly goes into completing a challenge/hack. I am going to do my best and attempt to do weekly writeups, hopefully the contents of this site can teach you something new. I am also new to hacking so I apologize if some of these writeups are not 100% factually correct, I am going to do my best to make them as accurate and informational as possible. In the future I plan to add further content aside from CTF challenges so stay tuned!

Happy hacking,

H0ax (Campbell) <3
